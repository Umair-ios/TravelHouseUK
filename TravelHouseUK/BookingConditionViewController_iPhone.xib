PAYMENT VERIFICATION &amp; FINANCIAL SECURITY

WHO ARE WE?

We are retail agents for an ATOL &amp; IATA registered organization with a proud decade of services in the UK market. The air holidays in our brochure are ATOL protected as we act as agent for licensed tour operators by the Civil Aviation Authority, as we are 'Retail agents' on behalf of ATOL holder Moresand limited. In the unlikely event of our insolvency, the CAA will ensure that you are not stranded abroad and will arrange to refund any money you have paid to us for an advance booking. For further information, visit the ATOL website at www.atol.org.uk. Schedule Airline Failure Insurance (SAFI) will be added to your invoice if scheduled airline flights are booked. For full details of the financial protection in place for your booking, please enquire at the time of making a booking.

HOW ARE YOU SECURE?

For maximum financial security of our customers, we have devised a foul proof and double check system. In this system once the reservation is completed over the phone and the confirmatory email containing all flight details is send to the traveler, the traveler is informed of the total cost of purchase / charged amount and requested to verify the same with her/his bank in order for us to guarantee transparency and precision.

Traveler/buyer may be required to provide secondary confirmation of total transaction amount as appearing on her/his statement or the authorization code of transaction. This can either be obtained through online statement check or making a call to the respective bank.

The exact amount (not a round figure but in pounds and few pence) must match with our records. In cases where the payment as stated on traveler"s statement does not match with the accounts records in our company, tickets cannot be issued (compliancy check failure).

Once the traveler/buyer confirms the total amount in exact figures (pounds &amp; pence) and provided that the payment confirmed matched 100% with the company records / accounts, tickets are issued immediately.

THIRD PARTY CARD PAYMENTS REQUIREMENTS &amp; OBLIGATIONS

If the card is in a name other than the traveler her/him self, we will require a hand written authorization letter Download Authorisation Form from the card holder (fax or scan), a colored photocopy (fax/scan) of both sides of the card itself, before any tickets can be released. Also, a photo i.d. such as passport first page (scan/fax) or driver"s license will be required for both the card holder and the traveler.

In cases where the card holder / traveler does not want to provide any or all of the above documents s/he may switch the mode of payment such as cash payment / bank transfer where no photo i.d. or documents are required.

One may visit our office with all documents and in case where s/he does not want to fax/mail the third party card documents.

In case, if satisfactory documents are not provided, our verification officer reserves the right to terminate reservation with or without cancellation charges applied.

The Payment verification and financial security procedure as stated in SECTION 5.0 is applicable in all cases.

CHANGES &amp; CANCELLATIONS POLICY

The following Changes and Cancellation policy apply on all purchase items / holiday / package / hotel / flight ar other services with no regards to mode of payment or mode of reservation.

CHANGES IN RESERVATION:

If, after a confirmation email/invoice has been issued, you wish to change your holiday arrangements / Flight reservation, we will do our utmost to assist you, However 98% suppliers particularly airlines, do not allow changes and tickets are strictly NON-REFUNDABLE, NON-CHANGEABLE AND NON-TRANSFERABLE.

Any change to an itinerary prior to receipt of your final payment will be treated as an amendment.

Depending on the amount of work involved, each change/amendment will incur a charge which will not exceed £50 per person; in addition to any further costs or charges that we incur from our suppliers in making the alteration considering that the airline/supplier rules/policy permits the requested change.

If full payment has already been received amendments may not be permitted in the airline policy, under these circumstances, amendments can be treated as cancellations and the cancellation charges detailed below will apply. However, generally cancellations are entirely non-refundable (unless specified).

Please note that most suppliers, in particular airlines do not allow a name change / date change or any changes and may consider this as a cancellation with a 100% cancellation charge (where ticket is not utilized as originally issued).

CHANGES BEFORE TICKET / VOUCHERS ISSUANCE

Reservations are entirely non-changeable, non-transferable and non-refundable, unless specified. However; Changes before ticket issuance are regulated both in accordance with airline policy and company policy and should be discussed with the concerned agent as rules may vary depending on carrier/supplier. Changes cannot be guaranteed and will depend on availability of seats/fares and classes. Also, Changes incur cost differences / penalty. 

Once a change is requested by the traveler, any previous/existing reservation and fares are dissolved to make changes and therefore, if a traveler chooses to retreat, it is not possible to offer the same previous fare again, or older/previous reservation or seats on previously given/reserved date. Hence in that case, any fare difference, charges or penalty will apply accordingly to return to reservation on original data. In cases where the difference is not paid or agreed by the traveler; yet the change has been ordered, the reservation will be treated as cancelation by traveler (Refer "CHANGES AFTER TICKET / VOUCHER ISSUANCE") and cancellation charges will be payable/deducted.

 Name Change Before Ticket / Voucher Issuance

Please note as airlines strictly do not permit name changes at any stage, if you require a name change prior ticket issuance; it can be done only through re-booking of seats. As we are seller of special and promotional fares available for short duration and few seats only, it is possible that upon rebooking (for name change) same fare, same dates or prices are not available. Under these circumstances any fare / cost difference as applicable, will be payable by the traveler. Fares are constantly changing and mostly raising, therefore any fare/tax difference as applicable on date of name change / rebooking will be charged accordingly and payable by the traveler. However, if the difference is not accepted or paid, the reservation will be subjected to regulations as stated in section 6.2 headed "cancellation by traveler".

Date / Schedule Change Before Ticket/Voucher Issuance

The date / schedule change requires to book the cheapest available or closest available fare or any available fare on the new/amended date. However, there may not be the same or cheap fare available on a new date or any date other than that reserved initially on request. Also, fares are revised every 24 hours and the airline may revise fares / or raise fares at any instance. Under these conditions, fare difference in addition to any date change penalty as applicable on new/changed date will be payable by the traveler. However, if the traveler refuses to proceed with the date change, after the change is ordered by her/him, the terms as stated in section 6.2 headed "cancellation by traveler" will apply.

Reservation Dissolution / Dissolved Reservations/Vouchers:

Please note upon ordering a Name / Date change, the details of previous/existing reservation are dissolved to make any new changes in your PNR / Record. Hence, one cannot revert to older reservation at same costs or seat availability may not remain open on same date, once changes are ordered and original reservation is dissolved to search for changes.

If the change or difference is not accepted (after ordering), the reservation may automatically incur cancellation charges considering that the former dates / reservation is dissolved already upon change order.

If the reservation or the fare expires or is withdrawn by airlines, clients may only opt for either alternative flights and pay for any difference in cost, or they may opt for a full refund. Please note that Debit/credit card surcharge(s) are not refundable sicne they go to a third party ( bank/Card Issuer)

Please note that airline refunds on part used tickets and the return half of the airfare are always less than the pro-rata rate and may have no refund value whatsoever. Refunds usually take 8 - 12 weeks but in certain cases may take longer or indefinite period such as Airline Bankruptcies. Please note, airlines are directly in control of refund matters, refund amount or refund date and the agency is only a communication channel, hence bears no responsibility for delays or differentials or airline actions.

Any other cost/damage claims or any other amount other than the cost of tickets / paid value to the agency cannot be claimed through or by agency and has to be claimed directly from the airline. The agency will only file, apply and follow up the tickets/voucher refund and no other claim whatsoever. The agency is not liable or responsibly for airline cancellations or other actions.

Ticket costs/damages/ accommodation vouchers value etc are to be claimed form the airline/hotel directly under any and all circumstances. However, the agency will provide guideline, support and follow-up if required for the "exact amount paid" claims.

CANCELLATION BY TRAVELER

In cases where a cancellation of flight/reservation is requested by the traveler, no matter what the reason there be, the airline cancellation policy as well as the company cancellation terms are applicable and can vary among airlines, fare types or season of travel *such as the minimal cancellation charges where the e-tickets are not issued are 100 GBP per reservation / per person (please check with your concerned agent as policy may vary with respect to airline / date or accommodation).

On issued tickets, the airline cancellation policy is entirely applicable where the cancellation charges are determined and deducted by the airline itself. *please enquire with your agents

Any remaining / outstanding balance is refunded between 8 – 12 weeks of cancellation of tickets, provided that if it is received at our end or if paid back timely by the airline. The refund is made in the same account (as charged from) unless specified.

Once the tickets are issued, the traveler and carrier/airline or accommodation is to deal directly and the agency is not liable to guarantee amount or time of refund, service, standard or operations of airline. However, we provide complimentary services to apply and chase refunds with the airline / accommodation on traveler"s behalf. Where the refund of remaining balance after cancellation is applied through us, our consultants follow up the refund (if any) and the received amount is paid back into the account from where it is taken. The date, time and amount of refund depend entirely on the airline and its respective policy and the company is not liable or accountable in such cases.

In most cases, flight tickets/reservations can be entirely non-refundable, non-changeable and non-transferable *please enquire with your agents.

In case of airline cancellation, the airline may provide alternate flight options OR full / part refund (depending on conditions / route / status of ticket). It is up to the traveler to accept or decline airline offer or choose refund/ alternate options. The traveler must contact the airline directly in these cases.

Once the tickets are issued, the total cost is paid to the airline and therefore the refund, status of refund, time / date of refund, amount of refund, or any financial matters, claims or complaints are to be directly sorted out with the airline. The agency is not liable or has any influence direct or indirect on the airline offering or operations and bears no responsibility of airline actions. In case of cancellation by airlines (changes which lead to refund processing authorised by airline) shall entitle the passenger to the full refund of all such funds that the airlines pays back to us. This figure may differ from the original payment made initially at the time of booking. Ticket issuance and refund application are two seperate activities and may be charged separately. In case the airline authorises full refund, there will still be charges applicable by us which will be pre-notiofied before applying for such refunds. However, we provide support, services and assistance in applying refunds, acquiring alternate options and in problem solving.

If you have any special requests (e.g diet, room location, room type, twin or double bedded room or a specific facility at a hotel or meal / seat allocation / wheel chair request etc) we will do our utmost to ensure that these are passed on to the supplier. We will also be happy to request pre allocated seating where airline policy allows. However you should note that we cannot guarantee that suppliers will accept these requests and that they therefore do not form any part of your contract with us.

DISPATCH OF TRAVEL DOCUMENTS / TICKETS

We aim to send out your travel documents (Itinerary/vouchers) to you at least 10 days before departure, unless you make a late booking or delay the confirmation of flights / payments. OR once you confirm and meet all requirements as mailed/communicated to you at time of reservation, considering the full payment is made and confirmed, the tickets/vouchers are issued and e-mailed ASAP (mostly 24 hours). In peak times this may not be the case. No tickets will be sent out unless final payment has been received and cleared. Travel documents (e-tickets / vouchers) will be sent on email as attachments and should be printed out or collected from our offices. In rare cases, where documents are specially required in post, they will be sent by Royal Mail Services (charges apply). However, we recommend that customers use Royal Mail "Special Delivery", a similar service or a courier and these can be arranged provided that you cover the additional costs involved. We cannot accept responsibility for items lost in the post and additional charges may be applied for any documents that are reissued.

*A traveler must make sure that tickets are sent to him and that s/he is in possession of the E-tickets at least 24 hours prior departure and that the ticket at the time of reservation should contain all correct information (name/schedule/destination). In case of delay or no receiving of E-tickets the traveler must contact the agent /manager immediately to acquire E-tickets or contact airline for confirmation or ticket numbers on basis of name / reference. The agency will not be liable for travel to the airport or any action taken without reconfirmation of schedule (48 hours in advance) or travel without e-tickets in hand or released.

LOST OR STOLEN TICKETS/VOUCHERS

Should tickets become lost or stolen, it is necessary to complete a form of indemnity to be passed to the airline. Some carriers are then prepared to issue replacement tickets immediately but may impose a fee for this. Other airlines require full payment to issue replacement tickets and will refund the amount paid for the original documents at a later date. This process can take up to 18 months. We will charge an administration charge of £35.00 per person if we have to reissue your tickets, in addition to any charges applied by the airline or supplier concerned, should we have to reissue your travel documents for whatever reason.

However, in case of most E-tickets, they can be re-send / emailed to you immediately once we are informed.

IF YOU HAVE A COMPLAINT

If you have a problem during your holiday/flight, please inform the relevant supplier (e.g. your hotelier/airline) so that they can Endeavour to put things right.

In case if you are experiencing difficulty with our consultant / travel agent, please ask for the concerned Manager"s direct number / email i.d. who will try his best to be you immediate problem solver.

You may send your feedback at the central Customer Services Department customerservices [at] travelhouseuk.co.uk

Also, in case of complaints where managers are not available or in case where you are not satisfied with the outcome please launch your complain at complaints [at] travelhouseuk.co.uk Our officer will get back to you at the earliest possibility

At time of complain please always mention your name, booking reference numbers and other details. This will assist us to quickly to address your concerns and speed up our response to you. If you fail to do this we will have been deprived of the opportunity to investigate and rectify your complaint and this may affect your rights under this contract.

Complaints and Customer Services are independent departments to support our valued customers and take a fair decision in best interest of the travelers and the company.

TRAVEL INSURANCE

We strongly recommend that you purchase comprehensive travel insurance when making your reservation. In certain cases cancellation charges, if incurred involuntarily, may be covered by insurance taken out at this time. We offer a comprehensive policy, which covers medical, and repatriation expenses, personal baggage and personal effects, loss or theft of money, personal liability and cancellation or curtailment charges. Please note we will not accept responsibility for any person who fails to be properly insured for their journey. Once the 14-day cooling of period built into the Insurance Policy has expired, we are not able to refund the insurance premium. This is a condition of the insurance company.

PASSPORTS, VISAS, HEALTH AND TRAVLER LIABILITES

Passengers must be in possession of a full passport and visas if required. Many countries require that your passport be valid for at least 6 months after your departure date from that country. OR that it should have at least 2 blank pages for stamp. Please always inquire Visa/Transit or Passport policy with the relevant consulate or embassy as the agency is not responsible or liable for valid travel documents / visas etc. Also, please contact your local doctor who can provide immunization requirements for countries where vaccination card is required along with travel documents to board. Advice can also be obtained from DoH leaflet "Advice on Health for Travelers". We can advise generally on Visa and Health requirements. It is your responsibility to ensure that you satisfy all applicable requirements in respect of passport, visa and health matters. We cannot be held liable if you fail to ensure this, and if as a result, we suffer any loss or expense because of such a failure on your part, you will be obliged to reimburse us. In addition, it is your responsibility to ensure that you do not behave in any way which causes offence or which risks causing offence or danger to other holidaymakers or which risks damaging property belonging to others. Hotel managers and pilots do have legal powers to remove unruly holidaymakers from their hotel and/or aircraft. Should this happen, we cannot be held liable in any way to you and you will be obliged to meet the cost of purchasing replacement hotel accommodation and/or air tickets.

PRE-TRAVEL ADVICE

The Foreign and Commonwealth Travel Advice Unit may have issued information about your holiday destination, travel, vaccination, security and visa information. Please consult or obtain reliable information from the appropriate department prior making any travel arrangements or purchase of tickets / accommodation vouchers or other services with us.

SCHEDULED AIRLINE FAILURE INSURANCE

Scheduled Airline Failure Insurance will be added to your invoice if scheduled airline flights are booked (Please inquire from agent as it may vary with respect to airline / destination). This cover is provided by Templeton Insurance Limited through Ashbourne Tilley (Special Risk) Ltd. Master Policy 2988 for which we are a Master Policy Holder.

EXTRA EXPENSES INCURRED AS RESULT OF SCHEDULED AIRLINE FAILURE

Any / All extra expenses are to be claimed from the "controlling body" i.e., airline directly in these cases. The agency does not bear liability of any extra costs however, we guarantee our support and advice where required in making and filing claims, follow up or providing supplier / airline contact information (as available to us). Also please refer to section 6 (b) under Changes and Cancellations 6.0.

PART 2 - PACKAGES

In addition to the conditions in "Part 1", these conditions apply specifically to those bookings classified as "packages" in accordance with the statement in "Your Holiday Contract".

YOUR HOLIDAY / PACKAGE / HOTEL CONTRACTS (Any/All Services)

Holiday is a reservation where hotel/accommodation as well as flights are booked or any other services as required during a holiday travel.

It should be noted that the conditions vary slightly dependent on whether you are booking a "package" or "other holiday arrangements".

Please note that different terms and conditions may apply between you and any of the airlines, hotels, tour operators involved in providing your travel arrangements. These terms and conditions can be acquired from our agents and will be provided to you on booking. Please note we are neither accountable nor liable for services, policies, standards or operations of accommodations, tour operators or airline. However, assistance and support will be provided where or when required in completing your reservation procedure.

By making this booking you agree that we may pass any information you provide on to the relevant suppliers of your travel arrangements such as airlines, hotels, transport companies etc. The information may also be provided to security or credit checking companies, public authorities such as customs/immigration if required by them, or as required by law.

Additionally, where your holiday is outside the European Economic Area (EEA), you should note that controls on data protection in your destination may not be as strong as the legal requirements in this country. A contract will exist as soon as payment has been accepted and a confirmation invoice has been issued. These booking conditions form part of your contract with us.

This contract and any matters arising from it are governed by English Law and we both agree to submit to the jurisdiction of the English courts. You may, however, choose the law and jurisdiction of Scotland or Northern Ireland if you wish.

Where the seller is acting as the agent for the Tour Operator you should refer to the booking conditions contained in the Tour Operators brochure. A copy of these can be provided to you at time of booking.

IF WE CHANGE OR CANCEL YOUR HOLIDAY (Packages only)

It is unlikely that we will make any amendments or changes to your travel booking after it has been confirmed. However because travel arrangements are often made many months in advance and because we have no control over some of the products featured in this brochure changes and cancellations may occasionally be necessary. We reserve the right to make changes or cancel your travel arrangements in any circumstances and at any time (Notification will be given). A change may be "major" or "minor". A major change would be considered to be a change in accommodation to a lower standard, or to a different resort, or the cancellation of a tour, a rescheduling of your flight departure time by more than 12 hours, or a change of your departing airport (excluding a change between Heathrow or Gatwick or an airport which is more convenient to you). We reserve the right to make a minor change and we will tell you as soon as possible. If there is a major change to your travel arrangements we will inform you as soon as is reasonably possible. You will have a choice of either:

Accepting the change of your package,

Accepting an offer of a comparable package (paying the difference if the alternative is more expensive)

or cancelling the package and receiving a full refund.

Please note that some tours require a minimum number of bookings to operate. In the unlikely event that a tour is cancelled due to low bookings you will be told as soon as is practical. If we are unable to provide you with a significant element of the package after you have departed we will make alternative arrangements for you at no extra charge. Package bookings are not cancelled less than 8 weeks prior to departure unless in cases of "Force Majeure" or failure to pay your balance on the specified date. This means that we will not have to pay compensation if we have to cancel or change your travel arrangements in any way because of war, riot, industrial dispute, terrorist activity, natural or nuclear disaster, fire, adverse weather conditions, unforeseen operational decisions of air carriers such as changes of schedule, or other unforeseen or unavoidable circumstances beyond our control. If the cancellation has not been caused by force majeure or low bookings we will pay you compensation as set out below: (Period before departure within which a major change is notified to you); followed by: Compensation per person: more than 56 days - Nil; 55-29 days- £10; 28 days or less - £20.

YOUR HOLIDAY PRICE (Packages only)

The price of your travel arrangements can be varied due to changes in transportation costs such as fuel, scheduled airfares and any other airline cost changes which are part of the contract between airlines (and their agents) and the tour operator or organizer. Also government action such as changes in VAT or any other government imposed changes and currency changes in relation to an exchange rate variation. In the case of any small variation, an amount equivalent to 2% of the price of your travel arrangements, which excludes insurance premiums and any amendment charges, will be absorbed or retained. For larger variations this 2% will still be absorbed for increases but not retained from refunds. In either case there will be an administration charge of £1.00 per person. If this means that you have to pay an increase of more than 15% of the price of your travel arrangements, you may cancel your travel arrangements and receive a full refund of all monies paid, except for any amendment charges. We will consider an appropriate refund of insurance premiums paid if you can show that you are unable to transfer or reuse your policy. Should you decide to cancel for this reason, you must exercise your right to do so within 14 days from the issue date printed on your final invoice. Whether you cancel or not you will also be entitled, on the terms set out in respect of major changes, to accept an offer of alternative travel arrangements from us if we are able to do so and compensation as indicated. Please note that travel arrangements are not always purchased in local currency and some apparent changes have no impact on the price of your travel due to contractual and other protection in place.

OUR LIABILITY (Packages only)

We accept responsibility to provide you all available or requested information on holiday package, accommodation or airline standard (you are advised to check flight/hotel reviews online for satisfaction or flight/hotel direct website for a pictorial over view). You can make your selection on basis of provided information, refuse a package or ask for alternates at the time of reservations. Please note our agents / consultants will try their best to provide you the best available rates and services as required by you in your order. Also, we recommend you should always check your flights/ holiday and package arrangements 48 hours to 72 hours prior departure / return incase if there is any schedule revision (normally due to weather conditions) etc. Also, where there is an earlier check in, late check in or any additional services are required we will follow up and pass your request to the supplier. However, the supplier does reserve the right to accept or decline special requests.

In cases where you are not satisfied with the services or standard of airline / hotel etc, our representative will assist you in the complain/claim process as such complains are to be directly launched with the supplier / hotel or airline and the agency is only a communication channel between the parties to provide cheap and affordable negotiated rates for packages. If you or any member of your party, suffer death, illness, inconvenience or injury whilst overseas involving an action or inconvenience caused by supplier / airline / hotel or other third parties, we shall at our discretion, offer advice, guidance and assistance to help you in resolving any claim you may have against a third party, provided we are advised of the incident within 90 days of its occurrence. We are only liable for our own internal services such as making flight / accommodation / package reservation on your behalf at best available / accepted rates, secure card / payment charging, or acceptance, timely / when required flight and accommodation reservation, sending vouchers / tickets and flight information to you or providing contact information (As available) of suppliers where there is a complaint or claim to be sorted out from the suppliers directly. The external services, such as standard of operations of any party or inconvenience caused by them are to be directly claimed from the party however we guarantee our support, assistance and guideline in such matters where required.

For your safety we strongly recommend Holiday/Traveler /Package makers to buy a complete insurance to cover for any medical or other undue / unpleasant expenses during a holiday.

PART 3 - OTHER TRAVEL ARRANGEMENTS

In addition to the conditions in "Part 1", these conditions apply specifically to those bookings classified as "Other Travel Arrangements" in accordance with the statement in "Your Holiday Contract".

IF WE CHANGE OR CANCEL YOUR HOLIDAY

(Other holiday arrangements) In the unlikely event there are any changes made to other holiday arrangements, we will try to tell you before you go, although we are not obliged to do so, nor are we obliged to compensate you as the change factors are external and not in control or caused by our company. If your booking for other holiday arrangements are cancelled we will do our utmost in assisting you to claim refund where applicable and directly from the supplier / hotelier / airline etc (controlling body). 

OUR LIABILITY (Other holiday arrangements)

Because we are acting as booking agent we have no liability for any of the travel arrangements, and in particular no liability for any illness, personal injury, death or loss of any kind. Please refer to "our liabilities" section for more details on the subject.</string>
